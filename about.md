Hi there,

You can call me Fox. It's been my nickname since forever. It used to be Wild Fox, but I have just recently (I mean, since somewhen around 2013 or 2014) changed it to `The IT Fox`, making it more or less unique; so, hey, if you happen to encounter another `The IT Fox` somewhere in some games, that's probably me.

I have been blogging since probably 2007, when first I started on Yahoo 360. It died, but left me some sweet memories. I blogged about random stuffs that time, when I was still in highschool, and it got probably over a hundred blog posts. I still have a copy of those, but they are too embarrasing to read, so let's start anew. Anyway, my point  is that I like blogging (but I'm also lazy af).

This blog is supposed to be a tech blog. It helps me keep track of stuff that I have done over the years working in the IT industry. Also, I like to train fresh graduates, so there will also be training series.

This blog is done on Jekyll platform, and I really like the experience. If you're interested, you may as well try it at [this post here](/docker training/2016/12/26/learning-docker-part-1/)

If you like me, then I'm also open for hire. Check out my [curriculumn vitae](/curriculum-vitae) if you're interested.
